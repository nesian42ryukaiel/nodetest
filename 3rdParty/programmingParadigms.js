/**
 * 1. Imperative Programming
 *
 * Imperative programming consists of sets of detailed instructions that are given to the computer to execute in a given order.
 * It's called "imperative" because as programmers we dictate exactly what the computer has to do, in a very specific way.
 *
 * Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates, step by step.

  if (nums[i] > 5) result.push(nums[i]);
}

console.log("1. Imperative Programming\n");
console.log("nums:", nums);
console.log("if number is bigger than 5, include in result");
console.log("result:", result, "\n"); // Output: [ 6, 7, 8, 9 ]

/**
 * 2. Procedural Programming
 *
 * Procedural programming is a derivation of imperative programming, adding to it the feature of functions (also known as "procedures" or "subroutines").
 * In procedural programming, the user is encouraged to subdivide the program execution into functions, as a way of improving modularity and organization.

/**
 * 3. Functional Programming
 *
 * Functional programming takes the concept of functions a little bit further.
 *
 * In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens,
 *   meaning that they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.
 *
 * Another key concept is the idea of pure functions.
 * A pure function is one that relies only on its inputs to generate its result.
 * And given the same input, it will always produce the same result.
 * Besides, it produces no side effects (any change outside the function's environment).
 *
 * With these concepts in mind, functional programming encourages programs written mostly with functions (surprise ðŸ˜²).
 * It also defends the idea that code modularity and the absence of side effects
 *   makes it easier to identify and separate responsibilities within the codebase.
 * This therefore improves the code maintainability.

/**
 * 4. Declarative Programming
 *
 * Declarative programming is all about hiding away complexity
 *   and bringing programming languages closer to human language and thinking.
 * It's the direct opposite of imperative programming in the sense that
 *   the programmer doesn't give instructions about how the computer should execute the task,
 *   but rather on what result is needed.

/**
 * 5. Object-Oriented Programming
 *
 * One of the most popular programming paradigms is object-oriented programming (OOP).
 *
 * The core concept of OOP is to separate concerns into entities which are coded as objects.
 * Each entity will group a given set of information (properties) and actions (methods) that can be performed by the entity.
 *
 * OOP makes heavy usage of classes
 *   (which are a way of creating new objects starting out from a blueprint or boilerplate that the programmer sets).
 * Objects that are created from a class are called instances.
